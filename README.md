## Installation and running client (React)
### I was using create-react-app npm from here `https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app`
### goto git ``
1. cd nimbl3-test-client and  `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`
OR
## Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  `yarn start`
    Starts the development server.

  `yarn build`
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  `yarn test`
    Starts the test runner.

  `yarn eject`
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

 ## We suggest that you begin by typing:
  cd nimbl3-test-client
  `yarn start`
